# qt_raytracer_challenge

A Qt (for visuals) implementation based on the book The Ray Tracer Challenge. The idea is to completely follow the book and create tests and corresponding implementation.

I'm trying to stay off any predefined data structures and algorithms probably done already in any standard libraries, C++ or Qt. For some parts I will use them where it makes sense (to me :). Consider this as a sketch/work in progress/playground.

The book can be found here: https://pragprog.com/book/jbtracer/the-ray-tracer-challenge.
